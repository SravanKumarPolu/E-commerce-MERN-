## üîç **Business Account Verification**

### **Expected Results in PayPal Sandbox:**

   - Balance should be **reduced** by payment amount
   - Transaction should show as "Payment Sent"

2. **Business Account** (`sb-j1ksk43419843@business.example.com`):
   - Balance should be **increased** by payment amount
   - Transaction should show as "Payment Received"
   - Should appear in Activity/Transactions

### **Expected Results in Admin Panel:**

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **If Business Account Still Doesn't Show Payments:**

1. **Check PayPal Order Creation**:
   ```bash
   # Look for this in backend logs
   payee: {
     email_address: 'sb-business@business.example.com'
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Payment Capture**:
   ```bash
   # Look for these messages
   ‚úÖ PayPal capture response status: COMPLETED
   üí∞ Payment received by business account: sb-business@business.example.com
   ```

3. **Check PayPal Sandbox Account**:
   - Ensure business account is active
   - Check if account has any restrictions
   - Verify account supports USD transactions

4. **Test with Different Amount**:
   - Try a small amount (e.g., $1.00)
   - Ensure amount is at least $0.01

### **Common Issues and Solutions:**

1. **"Payment capture failed"**:
   - Check if PayPal order ID is valid
   - Verify the order hasn't been captured already
   - Check PayPal API response for specific error codes

2. **"Business account not found"**:
   - Verify business account email in PayPal Developer Dashboard
   - Check if account is properly configured for sandbox testing

3. **"No payments in admin panel"**:
   - Check if PayPal analytics API is working
   - Verify admin authentication
   - Check database for payment records
