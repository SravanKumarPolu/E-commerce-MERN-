# PayPal Integration Setup Guide

## Backend Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```env
# PayPal Configuration
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=AbOtiWHzUtnR9K6vDyyfTHQw0px-yRPwUngXPDoN7HbRZSkyMR65KNCvNEqvEldeouNwTwRKihtu1pCl
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=EGCwPKmHOKPymyfH2csDwCCbdU2Ppv3C9QHnSOBR7ONYiIUk61nlrNRPq4O2vtAjIouyNd5RwfU6cdmm

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL (for PayPal return URLs)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# JWT Secret (for authentication)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 2. PayPal SDK
The PayPal SDK is already installed in the backend:
```bash
npm install @paypal/checkout-server-sdk
```

## Frontend Configuration

### 1. PayPal React SDK
The PayPal React SDK is already installed in the frontend:
```bash
npm install @paypal/react-paypal-js
```

### 2. Client ID
The PayPal client ID is configured in the `PayPalPayment.tsx` component.

## Database Integration

### 1. Order Model
A comprehensive Order model has been created (`backend/models/orderModel.js`) that includes:
- User association
- Order items with product details
- Shipping address
- Payment information (PayPal transaction IDs, etc.)
- Order and payment status tracking
- Timestamps and metadata

### 2. Database Schema
The order schema supports:
- **Order Items**: Product ID, name, image, price, quantity, color
- **Address**: Complete shipping address information
- **Payment Details**: Method, status, PayPal transaction IDs
- **Order Status**: Order Placed, Packing, Shipped, Out for delivery, Delivered, Cancelled
- **Payment Status**: pending, completed, failed, refunded

3. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production for secure communication
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for payment failures
5. **Authentication**: All order operations require valid user authentication
6. **Data Validation**: Input validation for all order data

## Testing

### Sandbox Mode
- Uses PayPal sandbox environment for testing
- Test with PayPal sandbox accounts
- No real money transactions
- Database stores test orders

### Production Mode
- Set `NODE_ENV=production` for live environment
- Use real PayPal business account credentials
- Enable webhook signature verification
- Real money transactions and order storage

## Troubleshooting

1. **PayPal Button Not Loading**: Check client ID configuration
2. **Order Creation Fails**: Verify backend environment variables and database connection
3. **Payment Capture Fails**: Check PayPal account status and permissions
4. **Webhook Not Working**: Verify webhook URL and signature verification
5. **Authentication Errors**: Ensure user is logged in and token is valid
6. **Database Errors**: Check MongoDB connection and schema validation

## Next Steps

1. **Order Notifications**: Implement email notifications for order status changes
2. **Refund Handling**: Add refund functionality with PayPal integration
3. **Analytics**: Track payment success rates and user behavior
4. **Order Tracking**: Add shipment tracking integration
5. **Inventory Management**: Connect orders to inventory system
6. **Reporting**: Add admin reporting and analytics dashboard
